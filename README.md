# Redux-Store
![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
Redux store is a full stack e-commerce app that allows users to view items available for sale, create an account, add the items to their shopping cart, and order them using Stripe. This is a refactor of an existing full-stack e-commerce application. The original app used React Context to manage global state. I refactored it to use Redux instead of Context. The app uses MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, Node and Stripe for payment processing.
